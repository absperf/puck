# Puck

Puck takes your app and packs it along with all your gems and a complete JRuby runtime in a standalone Jar file that can be run with just `java -jar â€¦`

## Installation

Add this to your `Gemfile`:

  gem 'puck'

You will also need a JRuby runtime, so add this too:

  gem 'jruby-jars', '= 1.7.4'

Make sure you specify a specific version of JRuby, and that it's the same as the one you're using locally. If you don't want to depend on `jruby-jars` for some reason there are ways to specify a path to `jruby-complete.jar`, see below for instructions.

## Requirements

Puck uses Bundler to figure out your gem dependencies, so if you're not using Bundler, Puck will not work.

Puck also requires you to specify the version of JRuby you want to bundle. The easiest way to do that is to add `jruby-jars` as a dependency, as described above, or provide your own `jruby-complete.jar`, as described below.

## Usage

You can use Puck either from the command line, or from your own code, for example in a `Rakefile`. See below for examples, and configuration.

Once you have a Jar file you can run your application like this:

    java -jar path/to/app.jar name-of-bin-script arg1 arg2

where `name-of-bin-script` is the name of a file from your app's `bin` directory. Any subsequent arguments will be passed to this script as if it was called directly from the command line. Everything your application needs to run will be included in the Jar, all gems and a complete JRuby runtime.

### Creating a Jar from the command line

Just run `puck` and it build a Jar file from your app. The Jar will be placed in a directory called `build` in your application's root directory.

### Creating a Jar with Rake

Probably the best way to use Puck is to create a Rake task:

```ruby
task :dist do
  Puck::Jar.new.create!
end
```

As you can see the code to create a Jar file is tiny, you can easily integrate this with other tools like Thor or your custom build toolchain.

### Configuration

Puck has some sane defaults, and let's you override most of them. It will determine the name of your application from the current working directory (which will be the directory containing your `Rakefile` if you run it from a Rake task) and it will include all files in `bin` and `lib` automatically.

If you want to include files that are not in `bin` or `lib` you can pass in the `:extra_files` option:

```ruby
Puck::Jar.new(extra_files: Dir['config/*.yml']).create!
```

or using the command line:

    puck --extra-files config/*.yml

There are two more options that you can set:

* `:app_dir`: your application's root directory, useful to set if it isn't the current working directory (and you're not using Rake).
* `:app_name`: the name of your application, it defaults to the name of the current working directory (and if you change that you don't need to change this too, you only need this option if you want a different name than the base directory's).
* `:build_dir`: defaults to `build`, but if you want the Jar file to end up somewhere else you can change it with this option.
* `:jruby_complete`: if you don't want to depend on the `jruby-jars` gem for some reason you can provide the path to your own `jruby-complete.jar`

They can also be specified on the command line (e.g. `puck --build-dir dist`).

## Answers

### Why not just use Warbler?

I've found Warbler to be opinionated in an unhelpful way. For example, if you have a `config.ru` in your application's root directory but don't want to create a War file you need to monkeypatch two classes, one of them seemingly unrelated to War files.

If Warbler works for you, you should continue using it.

### The Jar file is huge, is there something I can do to slim it down?

Short answer: probably not.

The JRuby runtime with all its dependencies clocks in at 20 MiB, you could probably slim it down a little bit by removing the 1.8 standard library, but apart from that you should probably leave it. Your gems also take up quite a lot of space, but usually you don't notice because they're tucked away in some directory that you never see.

Also, you're not going to put it on a floppy, you're going to send it over a network that handles megabytes per second, it's probably ok that you app is 50 MiB.
